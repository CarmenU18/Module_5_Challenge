# Overview of the analysis

- Analyze the data from the P&Ber by type of city: urban, suburban and rural. In order to understand the needs of the different regions.
- The analysis collected from the 3 regions will help identify usage trends and rates related to such usage.

# Results

- An analysis was conducted to determine the total trips, total drivers and total fares for each type of city, as well as the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per driver
- We can observe that 68% of total rides are made in urban cities versus only 5% in rural cities, these figures make sense when looking at the total number of drivers found in each of the types of cities, where 80% are found in urban cities, 16% in suburban cities and only 3% in rural cities.
- Urban cities have the lowest average per ride, 40% lower than rural cities where the average per trip is the highest and where the rate per driver is three times more than in urban cities.
This can be explained by the number of drivers available in each type of city, a higher number of drivers implies a lower price per ride.

- The graph of total weekly tariffs by type of city shows what has already been identified; urban cities have the highest total fares, followed by suburban cities, and lastly, rural cities have the lowest total fares.

# Summary

Based on our analysis, it can be concluded that there is a need to balance resources on a supply/demand basis. For example, moving approximately 5% of drivers from urban to rural cities would help balance fares and trip averages in both cities, where the rural population would benefit from a lower cost per trip, drivers reduce workload with a slight impact on current driver fares, while in urban cities the impact would be marginal.
